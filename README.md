# Screenshot-Script
Screenshot Script made in Python using Tkinter and PyQt5. The script first checks if there is a "screenshots" folder in the project directory; if not, it creates one. When you press the F2 button on your keyboard, the screenshot screen opens, allowing you to draw around the area you want to capture. Once you're done selecting, the screenshot will automatically copy to your clipboard for easy sharing. All screenshots are also saved in the "screenshots" folder.
